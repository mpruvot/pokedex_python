# Python Pokedex Project

This repository is a reflection of my journey in learning Python. It represents a personal project where I've built a simple wrapper around the Pokémon API. The goal was to practice interacting with external APIs and to solidify my Python programming skills.

## Project Description

In this project, I've created a Python script that interacts with the Pokémon API to fetch and store data about Pokémon. It's a command-line application that allows users to enter a Pokémon's name or ID and retrieve detailed information about it, including downloading its image sprites.

## Features

- **Fetch Pokémon Data**: Retrieve detailed information about Pokémon by name or ID.
- **Download Sprites**: Automatically download and save Pokémon sprites to a local directory.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for a smooth user experience.
- **Data Parsing**: Parse and display Pokémon statistics in a user-friendly format.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, I've learned to:

- **Make HTTP Requests**: Utilize the `requests` library in Python to make API calls.
- **File I/O**: Handle file operations for saving data locally.
- **Exception Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.
- **Logging**: Use Python's logging library to keep track of events and errors.
- **Data Structures**: Work with dictionaries and lists to organize and manipulate data.
